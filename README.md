# book-friend
I love books :D and sometimes I would like that someone/something show me my favourites parts from a book, I mean not the structure of a book but the content, my favourite quotes or phrases, because most of the time I forget them(poor of them), so this is my personal project to put in practice exciting technologies such as Microservices, Docker, [Kubernetes], Scala (I hadn't programmed anything in Scala before).
